we can export module in diffrent ways
module.export = {add modules names here}
module.exports.nameofthefunction = ()=>{}

if export like module.export it will point out diffrent refernece

similar to obj
const obj1 = {name : 'Ansa'}
const obj2 = obj1 //obj2 is refreing to the same obj1
obj2.name = 'new anme'
console.log(obj1.name) // will also shows new name because both obj1 and obj2 is refering to same address

but if let obj2 = obj1;
obj2 = {name : 'new name'}
console.log(obj1.name) // get Ansa, because it they are refering to diffrent address  same as module.exports


using mjs extention which id es module extension we can export uisng the key word export, also it has named export and default export
